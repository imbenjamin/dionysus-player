# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

Dionysus Player is a native iOS/iPadOS client for Jellyfin media servers (tvOS/macOS
planned later). It talks to a Jellyfin server over the plain REST/JSON API
(https://api.jellyfin.org/) and plays media via AetherEngine, a third-party
FFmpeg + VideoToolbox playback engine (HDR10/HDR10+/Dolby Vision support), pulled
in as a Swift Package.

**Status: early skeleton, unbuilt.** This was scaffolded without access to a
macOS/Xcode toolchain, so nothing here has been compiled. Expect the first build
to surface real compiler errors, most likely in
`DionysusPlayer/Core/Playback/AetherPlaybackEngine.swift` — its calls into
AetherEngine were written against published docs, not the actual compiled API.
SwiftUI views and the Jellyfin networking client are written directly against
Apple SDKs and the documented REST API, so they should need little to no
adjustment. When fixing build errors, check `AetherPlaybackEngine.swift` first.

## Commands

The Xcode project (`DionysusPlayer.xcodeproj`) is generated from `project.yml`
via XcodeGen rather than committed — this keeps project structure a readable
diff instead of an opaque `.pbxproj`. **Whenever `project.yml` changes, or the
set of source files changes, regenerate the project:**

```sh
xcodegen generate
```

To build/run, open the generated project and build the `DionysusPlayer`
scheme (target iOS 17+):

```sh
open DionysusPlayer.xcodeproj
```

There is no CLI build/test invocation set up yet (no test target exists in
`project.yml`). If you add one, wire its `xcodebuild test` invocation here.

## Architecture

The app is a straight linear state machine at the top, with feature modules
underneath that each follow the same MVVM shape.

### App-level flow (`App/`)

`AppState` (`App/AppState.swift`) is the single source of truth for where the
user is in the app, driven by a `Phase` enum: `.serverSetup` → `.login` →
`.main`. It also owns the `JellyfinAPIClient` instance, since the client's
base URL depends on which server was configured — there is one client per
configured server, created in `completeServerSetup` and recreated on
`start()`. `RootView` just switches on `appState.phase`. Session persistence
(`ServerSessionStore`, `Core/Persistence/`) splits storage by sensitivity:
server config in `UserDefaults`, credentials/access token in the Keychain
(`KeychainStore`). On launch, `AppState.start()` restores the server, then
attempts silent sign-in with stored credentials before falling back to the
login screen.

### Networking (`Core/Networking/`)

`JellyfinAPIClient` is an `actor` — all network calls are async and
serialized through it, and it holds mutable state (`accessToken`) that gets
set post-authentication. It's a thin hand-written wrapper over Jellyfin's
REST API (no generated SDK), intentionally scoped to only what the app needs:
server info, auth, browsing/search, playback info, and progress reporting.
`ImageURLBuilder` is deliberately *not* actor-isolated — it's a plain struct
snapshotted via `client.makeImageURLBuilder()` so SwiftUI views can build
image URLs synchronously without hopping through the actor on every render.

Playback today is direct-play only: `streamURL(itemID:mediaSourceID:container:)`
builds a static stream URL. `PlaybackInfoResponse`/`DeviceProfile`-based
transcode negotiation is not implemented yet — if asked to add transcoding,
this is the file to extend.

### Playback (`Core/Playback/`)

`PlaybackEngine` is a protocol wrapping AetherEngine so feature code never
depends on the third-party library directly — `AetherPlaybackEngine` is the
real adapter, `PreviewPlaybackEngine` (`#if DEBUG`-gated) is a fake used only
in SwiftUI previews. When changing playback behavior, change the protocol
and both conformers; `PlayerViewModel` should only ever talk to the
`PlaybackEngine` abstraction.

### Features (`Features/*`)

Each feature folder is a vertical slice: a SwiftUI `View` + an `@Observable`
`@MainActor` ViewModel that owns a `JellyfinAPIClient` reference and exposes a
`LoadState`-style enum (`idle`/`loading`/`loaded`/`failed`) for the view to
switch on. ViewModels are constructed with an already-resolved `client` and
`userID` (see `HomeViewModel.init`) rather than reaching into `AppState`
themselves — when adding a new feature screen, follow this pattern rather
than injecting `AppState` directly into ViewModels.

Rail/grid selection logic (what shows up on Home, in what order) is
explicitly a placeholder per the ViewModel doc comments — don't over-invest
in "correct" curation logic there without checking if it's being redesigned.

### Navigation (`Shared/Navigation/`)

Single shared `AppRoute` enum (`collection`, `assetDetail`) used as the
`navigationDestination(for:)` type across all three tabs in `MainTabView`
(Home/Search/Profile), each with its own `NavigationStack`. Adding a new
pushable destination means adding a case to `AppRoute` and a branch in
`AppRouteDestinationView`, not a per-feature navigation type.

### Models (`Core/Models/`)

Jellyfin API DTOs (`JellyfinModels.swift`) are kept separate from the app's
own lighter view-facing models (e.g. `MediaItem`, `MediaCollectionRail`) —
DTOs get mapped into app models (usually via an `init(dto:images:)`
initializer) rather than passed directly to views.
